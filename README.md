## INCOME LEVEL PREDICTION

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a personâ€™s
income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. By leveraging various census data, we will
explore the data, engineer relevant features, build and evaluate the predictive model, and
provide insights from the data.

The dataset used for this project is the "income_data.csv" file. It contains demographic information about individuals and aims to predict whether a person's income exceeds $50,000 per year, you can find the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O62ieo1jeXcqkU8uS_iR2C2Fr6VtR-PD/view?usp=sharing)
