## INCOME LEVEL PREDICTION

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a personâ€™s
income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. By leveraging various census data, we will
explore the data, engineer relevant features, build and evaluate the predictive model, and
provide insights from the data.

### DATASET DESCRIPTION
The dataset used for this project is the "income_data.csv" file. It contains detailed information about financial status of individuals across different countries and includes columns such as income, capital gain, capital loss, age, race, occupation, education, marital status,amongst others. It has 15 columns and 48842 observations. 

### PYTHON LIBRARIES USED

- Pandas- for working with dataframes
- Numpy- for numerical computation
- Matplotlib- for visualization and visual formatting
- Seaborn- for visualization
- Sklearn- for building and evaluating our machine learning model

### DATA COLLECTION AND PREPARATION

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Importing relevant libraries
2. Data loading and inspection
3. Handling missing data values and duplicates
4. Data cleaning and formatting

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

EDA involved exploring the income data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the average age, capital gain, capital losss and hours per week from the data?
- Which income level has the highest occurence?
- What is the ditribution of various categories in the data?
- How do different factors affect the income levels-age, gender, occupation, race etc?

- ### RESULT/FINDINGS
- 
1. The average age was
2. The income level with the highest occurence is 
3. The occupation, education, race, sex with income greater than 50k are
4. Correlation: There is lillte or no relationship between the numericla variables
5.
