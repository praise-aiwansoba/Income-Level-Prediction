## INCOME LEVEL PREDICTION

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a personâ€™s
income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. By leveraging various census data, we will
explore the data, engineer relevant features, build and evaluate the predictive model, and
provide insights from the data.

### DATASET DESCRIPTION
The dataset used for this project is the "income_data.csv" file. It contains detailed information about financial status of individuals across different countries and includes columns such as income, capital gain, capital loss, age, race, occupation, education, marital status,amongst others. It has 15 columns and 48842 observations. 

### PYTHON LIBRARIES USED

- Pandas- for working with dataframes
- Numpy- for numerical computation
- Matplotlib- for visualization and visual formatting
- Seaborn- for visualization
- Sklearn- for building and evaluating our machine learning model

### DATA COLLECTION AND PREPARATION

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Importing relevant libraries
2. Data loading and inspection
3. Handling missing data values and duplicates
4. Data cleaning and formatting

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

EDA involved exploring the income data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the average age, capital gain, capital losss and hours per week from the data?
- Which income level has the highest occurence?
- What is the ditribution of various categories in the data?
- How do different factors affect the income levels-age, gender, occupation, race etc?

- ### RESULT/FINDINGS

1. **Income Distribution:** The number of people who earn less than 50k/yr are far more than the number of people who earn more than 50k/yr.
2. **Age vs Income:** Although the age grade 30-40 had the highest representation in the data, those who earn more than 50k/yr were within `40-50 years`.
3. **Race vs Income:** The `whites` earning more than 50k/yr were more than other races. Only negligible proportion of other races earned above 50k/yr. Could this be due to racism?
4. **Marital Status vs Income:** The `never married` group had the most persons in the <=50k/yr income level while the `married -civ-spouse` had the highest number of  persons earning above 50k/yr.
5. **Education vs income:** `Prof school` had the highest number of people earning above 50k/yr, closely followed by doctorate and masters. Although, this had a smaller representation in the data but more people in this education levels earned more than 50k/yr. Other groups like HS-grad, pre-school etc had more people earning less than 50k/yr. This shows that Education impacts your level of income.
6. **Gender Distribution:** The `males` had more representation and earned more than the females.
7. **Native Country vs Income:** The `United States` had a greater representation from the rest countries. We also noticed an unknown group *('?')*
8. **Occupation vs Income:** `Exec-managerial` and `prof-specialty` had the highest number of people earning over 50k/yr. Admin-clerical and craft repair has the highest number earning less than 50k/yr. We also notice some missing values '?'
9. **Workclass vs Income:** Those in the `self-emp-inc` group  and `federal-govt` have more persons who earn more than 50k/yr, while we have most persons in the 'private' group earning less than 50k/yr. some missing values were also present.
10. **Correlation:** There is a `weak positive correlation` between income and age, income and capital gain and income and hours per week. A very weak negative correlation was observed between capital gain and capital loss.
